So, in this step by step tutorials, we will explore not only the code, but the most important ideas, techniques, and skills that you will always need when doing any iOS development. After completing this step by step tutorial, you will;

 - Get comfortable with the Xcode 9 and the Swift 4 programming language. 
 - Cover how to create iOS projects. 
 - Build iOS user interfaces that can automatically adjust themselves to work on multiple devices, from the smallest iPhone to the largest iPad, and everything in between, including the latest iPhone X.

## Prerequisites

Before starting iOS development, the first and the most important thing you will need is a Mac running macOS High Sierra, or at least Sierra. 

 - In Apple development world, it is a good idea to be on the latest version of macOS. 
 - The second thing you will need is Xcode 9 installed on that Mac. 
 - It is assumed that you are familiar with the Swift programming language. You do not need to be a Swift master, but at least you can comfortably read and understand Swift code.

 - It includes all the features you need to design, develop, and debug an app. 
 - Xcode also contains the iOS SDK, which extends Xcode to include the tools, compilers, and frameworks you need specifically for iOS development.
