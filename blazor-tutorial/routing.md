# Routing

## What are the Route and Routing?

A Route is a URL pattern, and Routing is a pattern matching process that monitors the requests and determines what to do with each request.

 - Blazor provides a client-side router. 
 - The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Routing.Router class provides Routing in Blazor.
 - In Blazor, the `<Router>` component enables routing, and a route template is provided to each accessible component. 
 - The `<Router>` component appears in the `App.cshtml` file.

```csharp
<!--
    Configuring this here is temporary. Later we'll move the app config
    into Program.cs, and it won't be necessary to specify AppAssembly.
-->
<Router AppAssembly=typeof(Program).Assembly />
```

## Route Templates

In Blazor, you define routes using route templates. You can define a route template by adding the `@page` directive to the top of a component.

```csharp
@page "/"

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

Welcome to your new app.
```

The above component would be loaded when the user navigated to www.mydomaim.com/

### Multiple Routes

It is also valid to specify multiple route templates for a component. You can achieve this by defining multiple `@page` directives.

```csharp
@page "/"
@page "/index"

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

Welcome to your new app.
```

The above component would be loaded when the user navigated to www.mydomaim.com/ or www.mydomaim.com/index.

### Define Route for pure C# Component

If you are defining your component as a pure C# class, then you can specify its route template by decorating it with the route attribute. 

```csharp
[Route("/counter")]
public class CounterClass : BlazorComponent
{
    // code here
}
```

It is ultimately what the `@page` directive gets compiled to.

 - When a *.cshtml file with an @page directive is compiled, the generated class is given a RouteAttribute specifying the route template. 
 - At runtime, the router looks for component classes with a RouteAttribute and renders whichever component has a route template that matches the requested URL.

## Route parameters

The Blazor client-side router uses route parameters to populate the corresponding component parameters with the same name (case insensitive).

```csharp
@page "/route-parameter"
@page "/route-parameter/{text}"

<h1>Blazor is @Text!</h1>

@functions {
    [Parameter]
    private string Text { get; set; } = "awesome";
}
```

Optional parameters aren't supported yet, so two `@page` directives are applied in the above example. 

The first `@page` directive permits navigation to the component without a parameter.

The second `@page` directive takes the `{text}` route parameter and assigns the value to the Text property.
