# CLR Debugging

SQL Server provides support for debugging CLR objects in the database. Debugging in SQL Server follows a per-connection model. A debugger can detect and debug activities only to the client connection to which it is attached. 

 - Users can step seamlessly into CLR objects from Transact-SQL, and vice versa. 
 - You can debug the CLR objects by using the debuggers in Visual Studio. 

To debug CLR objects in Visual Studio, let's add **TestScripts** folder and then add **Test.sql** which is going to be the default test script source file. 

```sql
SELECT dbo.MaxVariance(Salary) As MaxVariance
FROM Employees
```
Add the test script that you want to debug. To make this script a default one, let's go to the project properties.

On the Debug page, choose the Startup Scrip and browse to the Test.sql file. In the **Debug** menu, select **Start Debugging** to compile, and test the project. 

The test script in Test.sql will be invoked.

Now press ***F10*** button and it will call the `Init` method.

## Note 

 - Managed database object debugging in Visual Studio supports all common debugging features, such as **"step into"** and **"step over"** statements within routines executing on the server. 
 - Debuggers can set breakpoints, inspect the call stack, inspect variables, and modify variable values while debugging.

## Debugging Permissions and Restrictions

Debugging is a highly privileged operation, and therefore only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role are allowed to do so in SQL Server.

 - Debugging CLR routines is restricted to one debugger instance at a time. 
 - All CLR code execution freezes when a breakpoint is hit, and execution does not continue until the debugger advances from the breakpoint. 
 - However, you can continue debugging Transact-SQL in other connections. 
 - Because Transact-SQL debugging does not freeze other executions on the server, it could cause other connections to wait by holding a lock.
 - Existing connections cannot be debugged, only new connections, as SQL Server requires information about the client and debugger environment before the connection can be made.
