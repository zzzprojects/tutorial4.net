# NuGet CLI

The NuGet (`nuget.exe`) CLI, provides the full extent of NuGet functionality to install, create, publish, and manage packages without making any changes to project files.

## Download & Installation

You can download the latest version from [nuget.org/downloads](https://www.nuget.org/downloads). 

 - The latest version is always recommended, and 4.1.0+ is required to publish packages to nuget.org.
 - The file is not an installer, and it is the `nuget.exe` file directly. 
 - You won't see anything if you run it directly from the browser.
 - Add the folder where you placed `nuget.exe` to your PATH environment variable to use the CLI tool from anywhere.
